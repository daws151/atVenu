# atVenu
Programming assignment for atVenu

The easiest way to launch the app is through the IntelliJ Idea IDE (macOS version is available from here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac). 
A WildFly (https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/) or Apache Tomcat (https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) server is what we have been using in class to run these apps. 
Once installed + configured, the app can be run from localhost:8080. The URL may be slightly different depending on how it is deployed. If opening the project in IntelliJ with the configurations I was using during development + testing, the URL will be http://localhost:8080/poster_sales/index.jsp. If deploying the packaged web archive (.war) file on the server the URL will be: http://localhost:8080/atVenu_Assignment/index.jsp.

For database connectivity, a MySQL or MariaDB server needs to be running on port 3306. An open source version is packaged with the XAMPP Control Panel (available from: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
